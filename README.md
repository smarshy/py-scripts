# Miscellaneous Python Scripts

A collection of some scripts I just happened to write for fun. Usage details are present in the scripts. Many of these interact with an API:

### movie_search.py

You can search for any movie/TV show using keywords and an optional page number. Uses the [Open Movie Database API](http://omdbapi.com)

### rhyming_word.py

Give it a word and it shall find all the rhyming words for you. Uses the [Wordnik API](https://wordnik.com/)

### review_sentiment

Contains nykaa_review.py - a script which analyses sentiments based on recently published reviews for a particular product page on [nykaa](http://nykaa.com)
I have put together a list of positive and negative words by surveying the website reviews as well as by referring to general such available lists

### quora_analysis.py 

Uses python package for quora to fetch user stats and perform a simple activity analysis.
